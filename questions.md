## Questions

### 1. How do I add a custom header image?
I added the -9999px text-indent to keep the text header around. This
pushes the content off the screen, but keeps it around for screen
readers and search engines.

### 2. How do I remove the social share links below each post?

I did an "Inspect Element" on the social links. The containing element 
had a class _pw-widget_. So I searched the source for that class and
removed the element with that class.

### 3. How do I remove the pencil next to each "posted by"?

I don't see this on the website. This could potentially be a feature
that only shows when you're logged in.

### 4. How do I remove the comment numbers next to each post title?

I did an "Inspect Element" on the number next to the title. The number
had a class _numComment_. So I searched the source for that class and
removed the element with that class.

### 5. How do I change the favicon?

I don't see markup for a favicon. Is this something that's controlled at
the Blogger Dashboard level?
